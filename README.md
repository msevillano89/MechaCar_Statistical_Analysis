## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

[IMAGE]
In generated summary output, each Pr(>|t|) value represents the probability that each coefficient contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model. Assuming a significance level of 0.05, according to our results, the vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. Therefore, we may need to change our independent variables and/or transform them and then re-evaluate the coefficients and significance.

The generated Adjusted R-squared is 0.7149. It signifies that 71.5% of the variance in the dependent variable (mpg) is explained by the independent variables. In addition, the p-value is statiscally significant (p < 0.05). Therefore we can assume that the model effectively predicts the mpg of the MechaCar prototypes effectively.
